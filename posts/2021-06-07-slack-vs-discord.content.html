	My work has recently moved our chats to Discord which
	was a welcome change to me. When I first started programming
	I would hang out on some slack servers lurking and
	learning about some of the more arcane aspects of computers
	like caches or the represention of Go's slices in memory.

<p>
	Despite the fond memories, I was always annoyed by Slack's
	model of having different logins for different workspaces. This
	isn't too much of a problem on a day-to-day basis since their
	apps allow you to sign in to multiple workspaces at once. But
	I've never understood why they do this. It's not like it's a
	distributed service like Mastodon, where different, untrusted
	parties are hosting the same software. All slack workspaces
	are hosted by Slack, and presumably the same software, so
	by distributing the passwords per workspace only makes it
	a slightly harder, having to iterate a list of servers to attack,
	to gather user passwords in the case of a security vulnerability.
</p>

<p>
	Discord, on the other hand, has only a single login and the user
	can join multiple servers. The benefits of this approach go beyond
	my own convinience. In particular, for most of my classes, people
	create Discord servers to get help on problems and clarifications
	on directions, and also to share memes. While I think Discord's
	target audience aligns better with college students, I think the
	simpler login flow make people more inclined to join. Additionally,
	it's easier to maintain friendships and a sense of community, seeing
	similar folks in the servers from a previous class.

	Personally, I'mostly happy that I have one less chat application
	running on my computer. Now, to get everyone on matrix...
