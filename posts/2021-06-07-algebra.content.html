	A piece of software I've had the idea to write for a long time
	is an
	<a href="https://github.com/ear7h/algebra">
		algebraic equation solver
	</a>,
	which I finally tackled a few weeks ago. I this post
	I want to talk about my motivation for this.
</p>

<p>
	I've had this idea since taking my first physics
	course (mechanics) in community college. In that course,
	we progressively learned formulas and equations describing
	physical phenomena like Newton's Laws of Motion and derivative
	(pun intended) formulas like <em>angular</em> momentum.
	Many of the equations share common variables, like:

	<pre>
		F=ma
		d = at^ + v0t + d0

	</pre>

	So, that you can create even more complicated equations:

	<pre>
		d = (F/m)t^ + v0t + d0
	</pre>

	This formula is not useful for understading the material at
	a high level, but is part of the process actually using the
	formulas. In homework problems and in real life, you're given
	some information and you need to find an unknown. For
	the formula above, the problem might be:

	<blockquote>
		If a toy car weighs 10 kilograms and it's motor
		can provide 2 Newtons of force, how far can
		the car go in 5 seconds, starting from rest?
	</blockquote>

	The problem, provides the variables mass, force, time, and intial
	velocity; and distance has to be solved for. As the class
	goes on, more formulas are added and problems ge more complicated
	(ex. when do two cars with different properties meet when pointed
	at each other).
</p>

<p>
	The one other physics class I've taken, at a university,
	(electricity and magnetism) worked similarly. Other classes
	I've taken have less emphasis on algebra, but still tedious
	enough to remind me of the idea of automating it all. Over time
	the idea has emerged for such an algebra solving system to
	be used for learning and remembering; imagine going through
	all the classes and adding formulas to a database so that
	it can be referred to later. Though, the database would be
	more like like a program written in
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming">
		literate style
	</a>, with human readable notes alongside the formulas.
